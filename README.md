And the team photos I used are from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12hVarUZZ0vGPNSmyXAUcjealuxE4EK4S?usp=sharing

Place all team photos in a `./teams` folder to pull from. It is required that a proper team photo have the first player (top-left) selected.

Make sure a `./updated` directory als exists for the final images.

The coordinates in the code are based on 4k image resolution images (3840 Ã— 2160 pixels) of the teams.

Run `yarn install`, and then then run `node index.js` from command line to run.
