And the team photos I used are from: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ODNhKWiAyPxDH5O7ac2Lx8GAW4lv7H1_

I had to take two photos of each team because one player is always highlighted which makes their image bigger. So for my script you have to separate these two team photos into a `./teams` and a `./first_players` folders.

Make sure a `./updated` directory als exists for the final images.

The coordinates in the code are based on 4k image resolution images (3840 Ã— 2160 pixels) of the teams.

Run `yarn install`, and then then run `node index.js` from command line to run.
